Go2 Robot Stand Up Example
==========================

This example demonstrates how to make the Go2 robot stand up using the Go2RobotHelper class.
It's a very simple example that shows the basic stand up command execution.

The Go2RobotHelper automatically handles:
- WebRTC connection establishment and cleanup
- Robot mode switching with firmware compatibility
- Real-time state monitoring and status display
- Exception handling and emergency shutdown procedures
- Proper resource management and cleanup

Usage:
    python stand_up.py

Requirements:
- Go2 robot with WebRTC connectivity
- Compatible firmware version
- Network connection to robot
