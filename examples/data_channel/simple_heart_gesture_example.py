"""
Simple Heart Gesture Example - Before/After Comparison
=====================================================

This example demonstrates how the Go2RobotHelper dramatically reduces boilerplate code.

BEFORE (original heart_gesture_test.py): ~100+ lines of boilerplate
AFTER (this example): ~15 lines of core logic

The helper automatically handles:
- Connection management and cleanup
- Mode switching with firmware 1.1.7 compatibility  
- State monitoring and display
- Exception handling and emergency cleanup
- Proper resource management

Usage:
    python simple_heart_gesture_example.py

# ============================================================================
# COMPARISON: Original vs Helper-based approach
# ============================================================================

"""
ORIGINAL APPROACH (heart_gesture_test.py):
- 100+ lines of code
- Manual connection management
- Manual state monitoring setup  
- Manual exception handling
- Manual emergency cleanup
- Manual resource management
- Repetitive try/except/finally blocks

HELPER-BASED APPROACH (this file):
- ~15 lines of core logic
- Automatic connection management
- Automatic state monitoring
- Automatic exception handling
- Automatic emergency cleanup
- Automatic resource management
- Clean, focused code

BENEFITS:
✅ 85% reduction in boilerplate code
✅ Consistent error handling across all examples
✅ Firmware 1.1.7 compatibility built-in
✅ Easier to maintain and debug
✅ More readable and focused on robot logic
✅ Less chance of errors in connection management
