Go2 Robot VUI (Visual User Interface) Demonstration Example
==========================================================

This example demonstrates VUI (Visual User Interface) controls for the Go2 robot using the Go2RobotHelper class.
It showcases how to control the robot's LED brightness, colors, and flashing patterns with proper timing and state management.

The Go2RobotHelper automatically handles:
- WebRTC connection establishment and cleanup
- Robot mode switching with firmware compatibility
- Real-time state monitoring and status display
- Exception handling and emergency shutdown procedures
- Proper resource management and cleanup

Features demonstrated:
- LED brightness control: Adjust brightness from 0 to 10 and back
- LED color changes: Purple and cyan colors with timing
- LED flashing patterns: Cyan color with 1-second flash cycle

Usage:
    python vui.py

Requirements:
- Go2 robot with WebRTC connectivity
- Compatible firmware version
- Network connection to robot
