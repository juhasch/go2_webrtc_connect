Simple Handstand Example using Go2RobotHelper
=============================================

This example demonstrates a simple handstand using the Go2RobotHelper class.

The helper automatically handles:
- Connection management
- Mode switching with firmware 1.1.7 compatibility
- State monitoring
- Emergency cleanup
- Exception handling
- Proper resource cleanup

Usage:
    python simple_handstand_example.py
