"""
Go2 Robot Handstand Example (Updated with Go2RobotHelper)
========================================================

This example demonstrates how to make the Unitree Go2 robot perform a handstand
for 10 seconds using the simplified Go2RobotHelper interface.

UPDATED: This example has been converted to use Go2RobotHelper, reducing
code from ~180 lines to ~30 lines while adding firmware 1.1.7 compatibility.

The helper automatically handles:
- Connection management and cleanup
- Mode switching with firmware 1.1.7 compatibility (sit-before-switch)
- State monitoring and display
- Exception handling and emergency cleanup
- Proper resource management

Requirements:
- Robot must be in a stable position before starting
- Sufficient space around the robot for the handstand maneuver
- Robot should be on a flat, stable surface

Usage:
    python handstand_example.py

Safety Notes:
- Ensure the robot has enough space to perform the handstand
- Monitor the robot during the maneuver
- Be prepared to stop the program if needed (Ctrl+C)
