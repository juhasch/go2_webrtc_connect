# Full Unitree Go2 WebRTC Driver

This repository contains a Python implementation of the WebRTC driver to connect to the Unitree Go2 Robot. WebRTC is used by the Unitree Go APP and provides high-level control through it. Therefore, no jailbreak or firmware manipulation is required. It works out of the box for Go2 AIR/PRO/EDU models.

## Supported Versions

The currently supported firmware packages are:
- 1.1.1 - 1.1.7 (latest available)
- 1.0.19 - 1.0.25

## Audio and Video Support

There are video (recvonly) and audio (sendrecv) channels in WebRTC that you can connect to. Check out the examples in the `/example` folder.

## Lidar support

There is a lidar decoder built in, so you can handle decoded PoinClouds directly. Check out the examples in the `/example` folder.

## Connection Methods

The driver supports three types of connection methods:

1. **AP Mode**: Go2 is in AP mode, and the WebRTC client is connected directly to it:

    ```python
    Go2WebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalAP)
    ```

2. **STA-L Mode**: Go2 and the WebRTC client are on the same local network. An IP or Serial number is required:

    ```python
    Go2WebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalSTA, ip="192.168.8.181")
    ```

    You can also specify the IP as environment variable:

    ```bash
    export ROBOT_IP="192.168.8.181"
    ```

    If the IP is unknown, you can specify only the serial number, and the driver will try to find the IP using the special Multicast discovery feature available on Go2:

    ```python
    Go2WebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalSTA, serialNumber="B42D2000XXXXXXXX")
    ```

3. **STA-T mode**: Remote connection through remote Unitrees TURN server. Could control your Go2 even being on the diffrent network. Requires username and pass from Unitree account

    ```python
    Go2WebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.Remote, serialNumber="B42D2000XXXXXXXX", username="email@gmail.com", password="pass")
    ```

## Multicast scanner
The driver has a built-in Multicast scanner to find the Unitree Go2 on the local network and connect using only the serial number.

You can use the scanner from the command line after installation:

```sh
go2-scanner
```

This will scan for available Go2 robots on your local network and display their IP addresses and serial numbers.
